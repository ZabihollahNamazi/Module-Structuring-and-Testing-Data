// Predict and explain first...

// this function should square any number but instead we're going to get an error

function square(num) {
    return num * num;

console.log(square(4));

// unexpected number
// we have a number given to function but its working on different variable
// we can give a number to function when we call the function and use it as a variable to work on it inside function "num"
