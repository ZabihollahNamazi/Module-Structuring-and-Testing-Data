// gives error tah decimalNumber has already been declared
// we have to call the function instead of decimalNumber - the we give a value to function for decimalNumber
// and we have to remove the line => "const decimalNumber = 0.5;" because
// if we don't remove it , the function always works on 0.5 and result always will be 50%
